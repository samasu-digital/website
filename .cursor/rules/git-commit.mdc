1. Focus commit messages on:
   - What was changed/added/fixed
   - Why the change was made
   - Any breaking changes or important notes

2. Use conventional commit format when appropriate:
   - feat: add new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - docs: documentation changes
   - refactor: code refactoring
   - test: add/update tests

3. Keep commits focused on the actual code changes, not the tools used to create them
